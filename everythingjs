# Everything JS

## Context

So, today is Tuesday, Nov 30 2021, i feel a lil bit rusty on the Javascript echosystem. 
I feel like there are a lot of tools but i don't know what there purpose are nor how to use them correctly. 
Some tools are so widespread that i already know how to use but i can't exactly explain. 
My goal with this project is at the end to have a clear resource that could help me and anyone who feels the same.
This effort will be a personal effort, i am not going to leech out for existing resources yes, i'm going to mainly focus on the documentation of the tools.

Here are some knowledge assumptions

Here are the tools i will cover (this could be extended in the future)
